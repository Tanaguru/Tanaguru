            <div class="test-detail">
                For each element that receives focus, the browser visual indication must not be removed (CSS property outline, outline-color, outline-width, outline-style). 
                Does this rule have been followed?
            </div>

            <div class="testcase">
                <span id="span" tabindex="2">A span with a tabindex can grab the focus</span>
            </div>

            <p class="test-explanation">
                Failed : the css property outline-color is set to red for the
                element with the id "span" when it is selected. 
                Knowing that the background color of the page is also set to 
                red, the outline will be invisible. The test is failed.
